# ADR-001: AI Model Selection for Cost Explorer Application

## Status
**Accepted** - October 6, 2025

## Context

The AWS Cost Explorer Official MCP application requires AI models to provide intelligent natural language processing for cost analysis queries. The application must reliably convert natural language into accurate AWS Cost Explorer API parameters.

The application integrates with AWS Bedrock Claude models to provide:
- Natural language query understanding
- Intelligent parameter extraction and AWS Cost Explorer API call generation
- Service name recognition and proper terminology usage
- Filter construction for specific services and purchase types
- Date range interpretation and granularity selection

## Decision

Based on comprehensive parameter quality testing, we have selected **Claude 4.1 Opus** as the primary model:

### 1. Claude 4.1 Opus (Primary/Default)
**Model ID:** `anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0`

**Strengths:**
- Highest parameter quality and accuracy
- Correctly uses full AWS service names (not shortcuts)
- Proper purchase type terminology
- Reliable filter generation for complex queries

**Recommendation:** Use as the default model for all cost analysis queries


### 2. Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Secondary)
**Model ID:** `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0`

**Strengths:**
- Faster response times than Opus
- Acceptable parameter quality for simple queries

**Weaknesses:**
- Inconsistent service name handling
- Sometimes uses shortcuts instead of full AWS names
- Lower accuracy on complex filtering

**Recommendation:** Available as an option for users who prefer faster responses and accept lower accuracy


### 3. Claude 3.5 Haiku (Removed)
**Model ID:** `anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0`

**Status:** Removed from production

**Critical Issues:**
- Consistently fails to generate correct filter expressions
- Ignores user filtering intent
- Returns unfiltered results for all AWS services regardless of query
- 0% accuracy on parameter quality tests

**Recommendation:** Not suitable for cost analysis use cases


## Supporting Evidence

### Benchmark Methodology

**Test Type:** Parameter Quality Benchmark

The benchmark evaluates how well each model generates AWS Cost Explorer API parameters, not the accuracy of returned cost data. This is a reasonable approach because AWS APIs are deterministic - correct parameters will yield accurate data.

**What the Benchmark Tests:**
- Parameter generation quality and structure
- AWS service name accuracy (full names vs shortcuts)
- Filter expression correctness
- Purchase type terminology precision
- Expected service/type matching in results

**What the Benchmark Does NOT Test:**
- Actual AWS cost data validation via boto3 calls
- Numeric accuracy of returned costs
- End-to-end data correctness against AWS Cost Explorer

**Test Queries:** 12 queries across 4 difficulty levels
- **EASY**: Basic service queries (EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda)
- **MEDIUM**: Time-based analysis (last month, current month)
- **HARD**: Complex analysis (cost comparisons, differences)
- **EXPERT**: Advanced scenarios (Reserved vs On-Demand)

**Scoring System:** 100-point scale per query
- Base Success (20 points): Query executes without errors
- Filter Presence (30 points): Correct filtering applied
- Service Names (10 points): Uses full AWS names
- Purchase Types (10 points): Correct terminology
- Expected Match (30 points): Returns expected service/type

### Benchmark Results Summary

**Model Performance Comparison:**

| Model | Parameter Quality | Speed | Cost | Recommendation |
|-------|------------------|-------|------|----------------|
| **Claude 4.1 Opus** | Highest accuracy | Slower | Highest | **Primary/Default** |

   - Not suitable for production cost analysis

### Cost Analysis

**AWS Bedrock Pricing (per 1K tokens):**
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: $0.00025 input / $0.00125 output (Removed from use)
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: $0.003 input / $0.015 output
- **Claude 4.1 Opus**: $0.015 input / $0.075 output

**Cost-Quality Analysis:**
- **Claude 4.1 Opus**: Higher cost per token, but superior accuracy justifies the expense for cost analysis
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Lower cost, but inconsistent parameter quality may lead to incorrect results
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: Cheapest option, but 0% accuracy makes it unusable regardless of price

**Decision:** Accuracy is more important than cost for financial analysis tooling. Using an incorrect model that generates wrong parameters could lead to incorrect cost insights, which is unacceptable.
